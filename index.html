            <i>Concerning Hobbits</i><br><br>
            This book is largely concerned with <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/ab/73/3eab73af950b0e89a02f4c6a7cedb704.jpg" target="_blank">Hobbits</a>, and from its
            pages a reader may discover much of their character and a
            little of their history. Further information will also be found
            in the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has
            already been published, under the title of <em>The Hobbit</em>. That
            story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book,
            composed by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become
            famous in the world at large, and called by him There and
            Back Again, since they told of his journey into the East and
            his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits
            in the great events of that Age that are here related.
            Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset, while some may not possess
            the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more
            important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and
            the first adventure is briefly recalled.

        <p>
            Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more
            numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace
            and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and wellfarmed countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not
            and did not understand or like machines more complicated
            than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though
            they were skilful with tools. Even in ancient days they
            were, as a rule, shy of ‘the Big Folk’, as they call us, and
            now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to
            find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though
            they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they
            are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. They
            possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and
            silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come
            blundering by; and this art they have developed until to Men
            it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied
            magic of any kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to
            a professional skill that heredity and practice, and a close
            friendship with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger
            and clumsier races.
